							<b>Parameters of 220 million stars from Gaia BP/RP spectra </b>
							<br>

							Gaia DR3 contains low-resolution XP spectra of over 220 million stars, giving a unique opportunity to measure 								dust extinction and its vatiation in 3D.
							<br>
							We build a forward model that maps (Teff, [Fe/H], logg) to Gaia XP, and ultilize this model to determine the 								<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7692681" style="color: red;"> stellar types, extinction and distances for 								all 220 million Gaia XP stars</a>.
							<br>
							For more details, please take a look at <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.1855Z/abstract" style="color: red;">
							our paper</a>.

							<b>Variation of dust extinction in the milky way</b>

							<span class="major">

							</span>


							The variation of dust extinction is modelled by the parmeter R(V) (≡ A(V)/E(B-V) ), which is determined by the 								size distribution and chemical composition of the interstellar dust. Dust Rv is an also important tracer of local 								physical and chemical environment, such as SNe, star formation and molecular clouds.
							<br>
							Ultilizing Gaia XP spectra, we determine Rv for ~ 130 million high-extinction stars in the Milky Way, LMC and SMC, which is the largest Rv catalog <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11394477" style="color: red;"> (zenodo)</a> up to 2024.

							<b> Physical explanation of R(V): Is it driven by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)? </b><br>
							<span class="major">
								<img src="images/Rv_sky_LMC.png" style="width:570px;height:291px;object-fit: cover;"/>
							</span>

							We find evidence of PAH-driven 𝑅(𝑉) variation observationally and theoretically. The 𝑅(𝑉) value in translucent gas has an anticorrelation with the PAH abundance, as the picture shown above. Growth of PAH strengthens the 2175 Å feature, of which the red wing contributes to B band extinction but is almost negligible to V band, which leads to decrease of 𝑅(𝑉).
<br>
If proven, this leads to a revolutionary change on the picture of 𝑅(𝑉) as well as all fields of astronomy that utilize correction of extinction. Notably, Type Ia supernovae are observed to have anomalously low R(V), which could be connected to potential PAH growth in supernova shocks. Our findings also underscore the importance of PAH growth in the ISM, a possibility hinted at by recent PAH emission trends with metallicity.
